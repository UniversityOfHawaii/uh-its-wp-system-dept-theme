# uh-its-wp-system-dept-theme
Theme for University of Hawai‘i System departments and groups.

This theme was developed by Information Technology Services (ITS) for use in their multi-site Wordpress web-hosting to be accessible, mobile-friendly, and easy to edit. As this is a vanilla theme to be used across many departments, change requests will be assessed based on the broad benefit to all users.

WP training documentation is accessible to anyone with a University of Hawai‘i login:
